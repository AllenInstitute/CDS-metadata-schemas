## Usage

* Capture and annotate schemas to improve data understanding and support mapping. 
* Facilitate schema-level insights for downstream data engineering and knowledgebase integration.
* Supports centralized reference for improved collaboration and visibility across teams.
* Inventory and value sets, and surface similar or overlapping value sets for harmonization efforts. 
* Scope of documentation may be bounded/prioritized to immediate needs for migration or planning.


## Documentation

Documentation that supports development, implementation, standardization, and description of BICAN metadata can be found in the `docs/` directory. 


## Table Schemas

Table schemas in data dictionary format are located in the `schemas/` directory. Schemas are organized as one document (CSV format) per LIMS2 table, in a standard data dictionary format.


## Mappings

Mapping documents are tables, flowchart diagrams, and other artifacts related to mapping the associations between LIMS2 tables.

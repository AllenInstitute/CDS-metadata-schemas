NIfTI and Analyze 7.5 are compatible – NIfTI simply adds additional fields. NIfTI images are registered in a local coordinate system. There is currently no support for spatial referencing information. Each NIfTI file contains metadata and a voxel in up to 7 dimensions and supports a variety of data types. Usually NIfTI files have a .nii or .nii.gz extension containing both the header and the data. For backwards compatibility with Analyze 7.5, NIfTI files can be split into a binary header (.hdr) and an image data (.img/.img.gz). NIfTI metadata provides additional information about the coordinate system and how to interpret the data of the image. This may include parameters such as an intent, a description, or fMRI-specific metadata. There are two variants of the NIfTI format: NIfTI-1 and NIfTI-2. NIfTI-2 improves the data types supported by NIfTI-1, as well as precision and voxel size; however, the two formats are not binary compatible. Currently only NIfTI-1 is supported by the NIfTI reader.

,OME TIFF,,OME TIFF format | OME TIFF file format,A format for storing microscopy imaging data created to maximize the respective strengths of OME-XML and TIFF. It takes advantage of metadata defined in OME-XML while retaining the pixels in multi-page TIFF format for compatibility with many more applications.,https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.3/ome-tiff/,,"An OME-TIFF dataset has the following characteristics: Image planes are stored within one multi-page TIFF file, or across multiple TIFF files. Any image organization is feasible. A complete OME-XML metadata block describing the dataset is embedded in each TIFF file’s header. Thus, even if some of the TIFF files in a dataset are misplaced, the metadata remains intact. The OME-XML metadata block may contain anything allowed in a standard OME-XML file. OME-TIFF uses the standard TIFF mechanism for storing one or more image planes in each of the constituent files, instead of encoding pixels as base64 chunks within the XML. Since TIFF is an image format, it makes sense to only use OME-TIFF as opposed to OME-XML, when there is at least one image plane.",,,,

",https://openslide.org/formats/leica/,,"The ImageDescription tag of the first TIFF directory contains an XML document that defines the structure of the slide. Leica slides are structured as a collection of images, each of which has multiple dimensions (pyramid levels). The collection has a size, and images have a size and position, measured in nanometers. Each dimension has a size in pixels, an optional focal plane number, and a TIFF directory containing the image data. Fluorescence images have different dimensions (and thus different TIFF directories) for each channel. OpenSlide currently rejects fluorescence images and ignores focal planes other than plane 0. Brightfield slides have at least two images: a low-resolution macro image and one or more main images corresponding to regions of the macro image. The macro image has a position of (0, 0) and a size matching the size of the collection. Fluorescence slides can have two macro images: one brightfield and one fluorescence.

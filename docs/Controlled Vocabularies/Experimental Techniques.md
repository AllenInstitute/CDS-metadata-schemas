High-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired on the intact, fixed brain prior to sectioning will provide a vital cross-reference for comparison while also facilitating registration of data to a common coordinate frameworks. HOLiS data will be analyzed to extract cell locations and cell type identities, generating databases that can be compared to standard neuroanatomical atlases, while also permitting careful examination of brain-wide patterns and inter-subject differences.                                 | <https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2022/Annual%20Meeting%20Symposia/1511_Imaging_and_analysis_of_3D%5B1%5D.pdf>                                                                                                                          |

The Pacific Biotechnologies version is a single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing assay. The ZMW is a structure that creates an illuminated observation volume that is small enough to observe only a single nucleotide of DNA being incorporated by DNA polymerase. Each of the four DNA bases is attached to one of four different fluorescent dyes. When a nucleotide is incorporated by the DNA polymerase, the fluorescent tag is cleaved off and diffuses out of the observation area of the ZMW where its fluorescence is no longer observable. A detector detects the fluorescent signal of the nucleotide incorporation, and the base call is made according to the corresponding fluorescence of the dye. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

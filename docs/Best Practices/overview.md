## Consistent Terminology

Use standardized terms from controlled vocabularies wherever possible. This ensures that everyone understands the metadata in the same way and facilitates data integration across different datasets.

## Accurate Descriptions

Provide clear and precise descriptions for each metadata field. Avoid ambiguous terms and ensure that the information accurately reflects the data it describes.

## Regular Updates

Keep your metadata up to date. As datasets evolve, ensure that the metadata reflects any changes in data structure, content, or context.

## Validation

Regularly validate your metadata against the CDS schemas to ensure compliance. Use automated tools where available to check for errors or inconsistencies.

## Documentation

Maintain comprehensive documentation for your metadata practices. This should include guidelines for data entry, examples of good metadata, and explanations of any custom fields used.

## Community Engagement

Engage with the CDS community to share best practices and learn from others. Participate in forums, attend workshops, and contribute to discussions on metadata standards.

## Documentation

Documentation that supports development, implementation, standarization, and description of CDS metadata can be found in the `docs/` directory.

## Schemas

Metadata schemas are located in the `schemas/` directory. Each metadata schema is accompanied by a README document that contains descriptive information about that schema.

Each metadata schema is reviewed and standardized by the CDS team. Documentation of this process can be found [here](https://alleninstitute.atlassian.net/wiki/x/E4DNJw).

## How to Contribute

The CDS team supports community input and collaboration in developing, maintaining, and updating metadata schemas and documents. You are welcome to suggest updates or additions to the metadata standards by [creating GitHub issues](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/CDS-metadata-schemas/issues/new) or emailing [data.curation@alleninstitute.org](data.curation@alleninstitute.org).

## Terminology

Metadata

**Metadata** is the human and machine-readable descriptive information about a data resource that is necessary for tracking and using the data it describes. In the context of CDS, metadata is descriptive information that is necessary for understanding data at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This information is provided in a structure defined by the schema.

A **schema** is a human and machine-readable file-based specification for metadata. A specification defines the metadata structure and fields, including field name, description, format, and cardinality.

An **owner** of a schema is the person or group of persons that assume responsibility for its creation, documentation, and movement through the metadata approval process.

**Contributors** are any members of CDS, Allen Institute for Brain Science or scientific community who suggest, contribute, or review updates to the metadata schemas.

**Submitters** are any members of CDS, Allen Institute for Brain Science or scientific community who submit data or metadata.

**Committers** are any members of CDS team or the Allen Institute for Brain Science with commit privileges to the CDS-metadata-schemas GitHub repo.

A metadata schema has the status of **submitted** if and only if it has been uploaded as an attachment to an issue ticket on the CDS-metadata-schemas issue tracker.

A metadata schema has the status of **under CDS review** if and only if it has the status of submitted and the CDS team has acknowledged its receipt and has assigned reviewers to the schema.

A metadata schema has the status of **under revision by owner** if and only if it has the status of under CDS review and the owner has received recommended changes from reviewers.

A metadata schema has the status of **accepted by CDS** if and only if it has been under CDS review and CDS has deemed there are no outstanding necessary changes to the schema.

A metadata schema has the status of **endorsed CDS standard** if and only if it has been accepted by CDS team, and successfully completed the CDS data standards process.
